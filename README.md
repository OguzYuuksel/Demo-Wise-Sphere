# WiseSphere
# User Description (App Store)
A new way to trick on your friends. The **Wise Sphere** can know every question you ask- at least your friends will think so. All you have to do is following 3 easy steps.

 1. Click the blinking sphere to write the answer to the question you will ask. While writing the answer, magic words will appear over the sphere. Thanks to that, your friend can't realize what you're writing.
 2. After writing the answer, a chevron-down arrow will appear on the sphere. As you can guess you should drag the sphere down. Then click the blinking sphere again and ask your question to the wise sphere with your friend- not the meaning of life or something like that of course.
 3. After writing the question, a chevron-up arrow will appear on the sphere. You know what you should do this time. Then ta daa! Here is the answer to your question.

 # Victim (in App)
 Nowadays, artificial intelligence makes people’s lives much easier and more fun. Yet, it makes human beings more predictable. If you ask who I am, I am the **Wise Sphere**. That’s right! I am one of the high techs but way beyond than you can imagine. Not only that question but also you can ask anything you want to me because I've already known the answer. You didn't believe me, did you? Come and try these 3 steps.

 1. Click the screen to write magic words. After all, every secret has its password like "abracadabra" or "open sesame".
 2. When you see a chevron-down arrow, you should drag the screen down. TThen click the blinking sphere again and ask me any question you want me.
 3. The opposite of the previous step, you will see a chevron-up arrow. You know what you should do this time. Then ta daa! Here is the answer to the question.
